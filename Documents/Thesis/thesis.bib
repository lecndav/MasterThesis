  abstract = {Cancer has been characterized as a heterogeneous disease consisting of many different subtypes. The early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have become a necessity in cancer research, as it can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. The importance of classifying cancer patients into high or low risk groups has led many research teams, from the biomedical and the bioinformatics field, to study the application of machine learning (ML) methods. Therefore, these techniques have been utilized as an aim to model the progression and treatment of cancerous conditions. In addition, the ability of ML tools to detect key features from complex datasets reveals their importance. A variety of these techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees (DTs) have been widely applied in cancer research for the development of predictive models, resulting in effective and accurate decision making. Even though it is evident that the use of ML methods can improve our understanding of cancer progression, an appropriate level of validation is needed in order for these methods to be considered in the everyday clinical practice. In this work, we present a review of recent ML approaches employed in the modeling of cancer progression. The predictive models discussed here are based on various supervised ML techniques as well as on different input features and data samples. Given the growing trend on the application of ML methods in cancer research, we present here the most recent publications that employ these techniques as an aim to model cancer risk or patient outcomes.},

@article{Strobl2007,
	Abstract = {Variable importance measures for random forests have been receiving increased attention as a means of variable selection in many classification tasks in bioinformatics and related scientific fields, for instance to select a subset of genetic markers relevant for the prediction of a certain disease. We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories.},

  keywords = {Pearson product moment correlation coefficient},
  url = {http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/8056/},
  abstract = {The association between two variables is often of interest in data analysis and methodological research. Pearson's, Spearman's and Kendall's correlation coefficients are the most commonly used measures of monotone association, with the latter two usually suggested for non-normally distributed data. These three correlation coefficients can be represented as the differently weighted averages of the same concordance indicators. The weighting used in the Pearson's correlation coefficient could be preferable for reflecting monotone association in some types of continuous and not necessarily bivariate normal data.In this work, I investigate the intrinsic ability of Pearson's, Spearman's and Kendall's correlation coefficients to affect the statistical power of tests for monotone association in continuous data. This investigation is important in many fields including Public Health, since it can lead to guidelines that help save health research resources by reducing the number of inconclusive studies and enabling design of powerful studies with smaller sample sizes.The statistical power can be affected by both the structure of the employed correlation coefficient and type of a test statistic. Hence, I standardize the comparison of the intrinsic properties of the correlation coefficients by using a permutation test that is applicable to all of them. In the simulation study, I consider four types of continuous bivariate distributions composed of pairs of normal, log-normal, double exponential and t distributions. These distributions enable modeling the scenarios with different degrees of violation of normality with respect to skewness and kurtosis.As a result of the simulation study, I demonstrate that the Pearson's correlation coefficient could offer a substantial improvement in statistical power even for distributions with moderate skewness or excess kurtosis. Nonetheless, because of its known sensitivity to outliers, Pearson's correlation leads to a less powerful statistical test for distributions with extreme skewness or excess of kurtosis (where the datasets with outliers are more likely). In conclusion, the results of my investigation indicate that the Pearson's correlation coefficient could have significant advantages for continuous non-normal data which does not have obvious outliers. Thus, the shape of the distribution should not be a sole reason for not using the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient.}
